## About
The AMV System Demo is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept prototype application.

### Primary Goals
- Create a system that displays mobility data as it flows through in real-time
- Provide a small preview of the data available on the AMV Platform
- Give insights for people keeping track of a fleet of moving objects
- Help in understanding the usage and finding possible improvements of mobility services within a certain domain

### Prototype Stage
This application is currently in a prototype stage.
Be prepared to see some rough edges or under-construction features.
During the ongoing development you may experience technical misbehaviour or small bugs here and there.
You may also feel like some key features are missing - because they are.
